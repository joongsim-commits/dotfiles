# Code Quality Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a code quality reviewer sub-agent via `spawn_subagent`.

**Purpose:** Verify implementation is well-built (clean, tested, maintainable).

**Only dispatch after spec compliance review passes.**

```
Use the code reviewer template from superpowers-requesting-code-review/references/code-reviewer-prompt.md with these values:

DESCRIPTION: [task summary, from implementer's report]
PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task N from [plan-file]
BASE_SHA: [commit before task]
HEAD_SHA: [current commit]
```

**In addition to standard code quality concerns, the reviewer should check:**
- Does each file have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface?
- Are units decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently?
- Is the implementation following the file structure from the plan?
- Did this implementation create new files that are already large, or significantly grow existing files?

**Code reviewer returns:** Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment
